      <h1>Chinamelon: What nature and creativity did to an Asian</h1>

      <p>Chinamelon, a masterpiece I accidentally gave birth to while I was experimenting with GIMP with my middle school friend as the model. The idea was to combine nature and Asian to create a sense of harmony.</p>
      <p>The Melon-Helm symbolizes how crucial nature is to Asians. The helmet protects their head, where their soul resides. Asians need food to protect their soul, to keep alive. Knowing how most of Asian cuisines are vegetables, we can conclude that they have been relying on nature to get nutritions, and experimenting on them to satisfy their likings.</p>
      <p>The watermelon being in a shape of a helmet also symbolizes how creatively Asians are utilizing nature. As written in the previous paragraph, Asians are known for their cuisines that are primarily vegetables. They needed creativity in order to develop their cookery. Asians also use nature as their art object as the most of their poems and paintings are about nature. They could build architectures based solely on natural items.</p>
      <p>I have never thought that I could make a masterpiece like this one. It clearly shows that Asians have formed a special bond with nature. I hope i can come up with a new masterpiece again. Thank you for reading :)</p>
